# On-Ramp user flow

Using our SDKs, there are several options to integrate MoonPay widget. For example, in a modal overlaid on top of your web app, or in an in-app web view.

To buy crypto, the user goes through the following steps in the widget:

1. Confirm the cryptocurrency, fiat, and amount to purchase.
2. Log in to the widget using multi-factor authentication (MFA).
3. Select payment method.
4. Go through KYC, if the user is new to MoonPay.
5. Confirm the purchase.
6. MoonPay sends the crypto to the user.

# Features

**Secure crypto transactions**: Our system supports 100+ cryptocurrencies and as the merchant of record MoonPay assumes full responsibility for all fraud disputes and chargebacks. All customers are required to pass MoonPay’s established Know Your Customer (KYC) and risk management procedures along with all applicable laws and regulations.

**Optimal conversion rates**: Millions of users have previously purchased cryptocurrencies using MoonPay, having stored their payment and KYC details, leading to maximized conversion rates.

**Diverse payment methods**: MoonPay accommodates a vast spectrum of payment methods for purchase and sale transactions: credit and debit cards, EUR / GBP / USD bank transfers, PayPal, Venmo and local payment methods like PIX and Yellow Card, as well as Apple & Google Pay, ensuring users can transact according to their preference. With enablement from the MoonPay team, users can now also fund wallets through MoonPay using centralized exchanges (see [Configure the On-Ramp user journey](/docs/ramps-sdk-buy-params).

**Customize the widget**: You can customize the widget to feel like a native part of your site or application by adjusting button and background colors. You can also add your company logo to the transactional emails sent to customers.

**Remove friction for your users**: Improve your customers' experience and speed up the buying process by pre-filling information such as their wallet address, email, selected token, fiat currency, amounts, and their preferred payment method. Users don't have a digital wallet? We can create one for them using just their email address as they go through the purchase flow.

Through social sign-in, users can effortlessly log in using their Google or Apple accounts directly from the widget, serving as a smooth connector between the traditional web (Web2) and blockchain-based platforms (Web3).
