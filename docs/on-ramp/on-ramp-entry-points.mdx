# Entry points to the MoonPay widget

Partner apps can show buy buttons in various places to give users easy access to the MoonPay widget. The most common places to show buy buttons are your app's:

- [ ] Home screen
- [ ] Main app navigation
- [ ] Individual asset detail screens

Highly visible `Buy` buttons in these areas reduces the number of clicks for users to transact and improves the user experience. You can also show `Buy` buttons wherever users expect to be able to transact, like their wallet, trading screens, and other screens specific to your app.
