## Overview

![](/images/docs/bb99175-Screenshot_2024-02-02_at_10.45.06_AM.png)

In this Quickstart, you will facilitate cryptocurrency purchases via the MoonPay On-Ramp directly from your browser.

Whether you are a complete beginner to coding or a seasoned expert, this guide will take you through all of the necessary steps to have you converting fiat to cryptocurrency in no time.

---

## What you will accomplish

In this tutorial, you will:

- Configure On-Ramps widget in a local environment

  - Create a new folder for code
  - Initialize the widget in a file using HTML and JavaScript
  - Edit the widget parameters
  - Display the fully functional widget locally in your browser

---

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, you will need:

- **A MoonPay account**: If you do not have one, set one up on [this page](https://dashboard.moonpay.com/).
- **An IDE (coding software):** Some popular ones are [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [IntelliJ WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/). We will be using Visual Studio Code in this tutorial.
- **A web browser:** Any web browser will work. We will be using Google Chrome in this tutorial.

## Implementation

### Step 1: Set up a file for your integration

In your IDE, create a new file for your On-Ramp code. Ours will be called on-ramp.html.

### Step 2: Retrieve API keys from the MoonPay Dashboard

- Navigate to your [MoonPay Dashboard](https://dashboard.moonpay.com/) and log in.
- Once logged in, navigate to the Developers tab on the sidebar â†’ API Keys.
  - Here, you will be able to copy your API keys. In this tutorial, we will be using the publishable test key.

### Step 3: Insert HTML and code into on-ramp.html

- The code below will embed our Software Development Kit (SDK) directly into your HTML by way of `<script>` tags.

  - You can think of this as a way of injecting code directly into HTML without having to create a separate linked file


  ```html HTML
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
  <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
      <title>MoonPay Integration</title>

        <!-- Adds the MoonPay SDK as a script to your HTML file -->
        <script defer src="https://static.moonpay.com/web-sdk/v1/moonpay-web-sdk.min.js"></script>

        <!-- Initialize the MoonPay SDK immediately upon page load -->
        <script>
            document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
                const moonpaySdk = window.MoonPayWebSdk.init({
                    flow: "buy",
                    environment: "sandbox",
                    variant: "overlay",
                    params: {
                        apiKey: "pk_test_123", // Replace with your MoonPay publishable API key
                        baseCurrencyCode: "usd",
                        baseCurrencyAmount: "30",
                        defaultCurrencyCode: "eth"
                    }});

                // Open widget
                moonpaySdk.show();
            });
        </script>

    </head>
  <body>
      <div class="container">
      </div>
  </body>
  </html>
  ```


- This script will detect when the HTML page loads and immediately run the JavaScript within the `<script>` tags when the load has finished. Remember to replace `pk_test` with your publishable API key from **Step 1**.

- You can customize widget functionality (currencies, amounts, etc.) by adding and removing parameters in the JavaScript, whilst still preserving proper formatting.

  - All parameters can be found on [this page of our documentation](/docs/on-ramp-configure-user-journey-params).

- For example, if we would like to display the widget with a default of _100 GBP worth of BTC_, and also specify the `walletAddress` in the parameters so that the user is not prompted for theirs, we could modify the JavaScript like such:

<CodeGroup>
  ```html HTML
  <script>
     document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
         const moonpaySdk = window.MoonPayWebSdk.init({
             flow: "buy",
             environment: "sandbox",
             variant: "overlay",
             params: {
                 apiKey: "pk_test", // Replace with your MoonPay publishable API key
                 baseCurrencyCode: "gbp",
                 baseCurrencyAmount: "100",
                 defaultCurrencyCode: "btc",
                 walletAddress: "enter your wallet here"
             }});
     
         // Open widget
         moonpaySdk.show();
     });
  </script>
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Step 4: Do a test transaction

- The first step of processing a test transaction using the MoonPay On-Ramp is to make sure that `environment` is set to`"sandbox"`, as shown above in the example code. This puts your widget in test mode.
- Next, open up the widget, enter your email address, and log in.

- Next, you will be asked to enter a wallet address if one hasnâ€™t been passed through the parameters already. If you already have existing wallet addresses with MoonPay, they will show up here. Any wallet address will work for a test transaction.
- Next, go and grab the **Test Credit Card** from [this page of our documentation](/docs/faq-sandbox-testing#adding-a-payment-method).

<Warning>
  Never use a test credit card on anything other than a test widget that has
  environment: "sandbox", otherwise your MoonPay account may be blocked.
</Warning>

- If successful, you should see a screen that looks like the below.
