Enhance your website or applications user experience by tailoring the MoonPay widget's appearance to align with your brand. These personalization options are referred to as a _theme_.

# Building your theme

Your website or application can feature a unique theme that includes a dedicated theme.

You can build your theme using [MoonPay dashboard theme builder](https://dashboard.moonpay.com/theme). Themes built on the MoonPay dashboard are tied to your API key and will show up wherever you use your API key (e.g. widget, transaction tracker).

# Implementing your theme

To apply your custom theme, simply set your newly created theme to the default and save the changes.

This will ensure that the widget or transaction tracker is initialized with the corresponding theme whenever you use your MoonPay API key.
