| `currencyCode`                 | The code of the cryptocurrency (e.g., btc, eth, matic) you want the customer to purchase. The customer will not be able to select another currency. To differentiate between networks, use the currency codes listed in the [MoonPay Dashboard](https://dashboard.moonpay.com/login?sessionExpired=true).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `defaultCurrencyCode`          | The code of the cryptocurrency you would prefer the customer to purchase. The customer can still select another currency. If both `currencyCode` and `defaultCurrencyCode` are passed, `currencyCode` will take precedence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `walletAddress`                | The cryptocurrency wallet address the purchased funds will be sent to. If you pass a valid wallet address the customer won't be prompted to enter one. When pre-filling wallet addresses, you must pass `currencyCode` and [sign the URL](/docs/ramps-sdk-url-signing). Values need to be URL encoded in order to generate a valid signature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `walletAddressTag`             | The secondary cryptocurrency wallet address identifier/memo for coins such as EOS, XLM, XRP and XMR. This parameter will be skipped if `walletAddress` or `currencyCode` is not passed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `walletAddresses`              | A JSON string representing the wallet addresses you want to use for multiple cryptocurrencies. If the customer selects a cryptocurrency for which you have passed a valid wallet address, the customer won't be prompted to enter one. The currency code must be lowercase. An example for BTC and EOS: \{"btc":"tb1qst9rvjnhym6kwmdkwgfs4h5dtp7cau5346jp9x","eos":"eosmoonpay23"} If you use this parameter, only the cryptocurrencies for which you pass a wallet address will be shown to the customer, unless you also pass the `showAllCurrencies` parameter. If both `walletAddresses` and `walletAddress` are passed, `walletAddresses` takes precedence. For the following token types, you only need to provide a single wallet address: BEP-2, bnb BEP-20, bnb_bsc ERC-20, eth EOS, eos Polygon, pol_polygon TRC-20, trx When using this parameter, you must sign URLs. Learn more about [signing URLs](/docs/ramps-sdk-url-signing). |
| `walletAddressTags`            | A JSON string representing the wallet address tags you want to use for various cryptocurrencies. An example with EOS and XRP wallet address tags: \{"eos":"myeostag","xrp":"0123456789"}. If the customer selects a cryptocurrency for which you have passed a valid wallet address tag, the customer won't be prompted to enter one. This parameter will be skipped if walletAddresses is not passed. If both `walletAddressTags` and `walletAddressTag` are passed, `walletAddressTags` takes precedence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `colorCode`                    | The color code for the widget main color. It is used for buttons, links and highlighted text. Only hexadecimal codes are accepted, for example #FF2B8F.

| `redirectURL`                  | A URL you'd like to redirect the customer to after they complete the buy flow in the widget. We will append the transaction's ID and status as query parameters to your URL. MoonPay will add transactionId=\{\{transactionId}}\&transactionStatus=pending to the redirectURL. HTTPS or Universal/App Link URLs are supported. Custom-scheme links (e.g., myapp\://…) are not supported.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `showAllCurrencies`            | Set this parameter true to show all cryptocurrencies enabled on your account, including those for which you did not pass any wallet address via the `walletAddresses` parameter. You don't need to set this if you did not use the `walletAddresses` parameter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `showOnlyCurrencies`           | A comma-separated list of currency codes. Set this parameter if you want to show only some of the cryptocurrencies enabled on your account, without having to pass wallet addresses for those currencies. If both the `walletAddresses` and `showOnlyCurrencies` parameters are passed we will only show matching currencies present in both fields. All other currencies will not be included.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `showWalletAddressForm`        | Set this parameter true to show the wallet address form, even though you've already passed a valid wallet address via the `walletAddress` or `walletAddresses` parameters. The customer will be able to see the valid wallet address, but will not be able to change it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `unsupportedRegionRedirectUrl` | A URL you'd like to redirect the customer upon coming from unsupported region. After the user lands on an unsupported region screen, they will be redirected to provided URL after 3 seconds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `skipUnsupportedRegionScreen`  | Set this parameter to true if you want to skip the widget's unsupported region screen and immediately redirect the customer. If you set this parameter, you also need to set `unsupportedRegionRedirectUrl`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
