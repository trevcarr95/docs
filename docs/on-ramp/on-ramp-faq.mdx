# On-Ramp Integration

## How do I change my API Keys?

Go to the [Developers > API Keys](https://dashboard.moonpay.com/developers/) page of your MoonPay dashboard and hit the roll button next to the API key you wish to replace. You will be given the option to immediately delete the old key or a 12hour rollover before the old API keys expire.

## Iframe shows an error instead of the widget

If you see a CSP error that says `buy.moonpay.com refused to connect`, you’ll need to allowlist your production domain(s). We require this when you embed the MoonPay widget in an iframe or use the overlay, drawer, or embedded options to prevent unauthorized third-parties from embedding the MoonPay widget.

To resolve the issue, add your production domain(s) to the [Settings page](https://dashboard.moonpaycloud.com/settings/) of your MoonPay dashboard.

## Region-based widget error

If you see a widget error that geo-blocks certain users, confirm that these users are in a region supported by MoonPay. [Non-supported countries, states, and territories for on-ramp](https://support.moonpay.com/hc/en-gb/articles/6557330712721-What-are-our-non-supported-countries-states-and-territories-for-on-ramp-product-)

## Sandbox Supported Currencies

Our sandbox environment supports a limited selection of testnet currencies; we recommend testing primarily with Ethereum on Sepolia, Solana Testnet, or the Bitcoin Testnet.

## Multiple accounts in production

In our production environment, we only allow one account per user. Creating multiple accounts in production may cause your account to be flagged or blocked.

## Test credit cards and KYC info in production

Only genuine card and KYC information may be used in our production environment. Do **not** use test credit card or test KYC information in production, as this will result in your account being blocked.

# Using platforms like Flutter

MoonPay does not offer an SDK for Flutter. You'll have to manually embed our widget in a WebView. Consider the following tips:

- You can create your own HTML that uses our [Web SDK](/docs/on-ramp-web-sdk) to embed our Widget. This will allow you to receive our Widget's events, if you wish. You'll then need to send them out to your Flutter app layer.
- If you're experiencing camera issues in Flutter's WebView, consider using the Flutter plugin compatible with our Web SDK, available at [https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_inappwebview](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_inappwebview).
- You can find further guidance on configuring Flutter camera permissions and other related documentation at [https://inappwebview.dev/docs/5.x.x/web-rtc/](https://inappwebview.dev/docs/5.x.x/web-rtc/).
- Custom Origin via `baseUrl` Property: For specific requirements, you can set a custom origin using the `baseUrl` property. This serves as the base URL for any relative paths in the HTML and sets the document’s origin. Example:
  <CodeGroup>
    ```dart dart InAppWebView( initialData: InAppWebViewInitialData( data:
    htmlContent, baseUrl: Uri.parse("https://your.custom.origin") ), // ...
    other configurations ... ) ```
  </CodeGroup>
  This custom origin approach can be advantageous for scenarios involving scripts
  that validate the document’s origin or for CORS policies. We recommend using `https://app_name`,
  `capacitor://` or equivalent as your custom origin for the `baseUrl` property.
  From here, add the domain to your allowlist in the settings page of your [MoonPay
  dashboard](https://dashboard.moonpay.com/settings/).
- Scrolling Issues within the MoonPay widget: When using these overflowing containers in Flutter with a WebViewWidget, you have to specify gesture recognizers: Example:
  ```
  gestureRecognizers: <Factory<OneSequenceGestureRecognizer>>{
    Factory<OneSequenceGestureRecognizer>(
      () => EagerGestureRecognizer(),
    ),
  },
  ```

# App requirements for KYC

<Warning />

These requirements make sure that customers can complete each KYC step, including uploading documents and doing a selfie check. Failing to follow these steps will cause new customers to drop off, as they won't be able to finish KYC or make a purchase.

## General app requirements for all implementations

All partner apps should ensure the following:

- [ ] `Feature-Policy` header for your webpage / frame or any other container has no restrictions for initializing camera like value `camera 'none'`.
- [ ] `Permissions-Policy` header doesn't restrict access to a camera and microphone (for some cases) and if allow is set check for `"camera; microphone"` values.
- [ ] When using [iOS WKWebview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebviewconfiguration/1614793-allowsinlinemediaplayback) you may need to set `allowsInlineMediaPlayback` to `true` in the `WKWebViewConfiguration` used in your app. This adjustment ensures that media content, like a camera feed, can be displayed properly within the web view, rather than forcing full-screen playback.
- [ ] Your website is being run on a secure `https` connection.

## WebView requirements

Partner apps that use `WebView` should ensure the following:

- [ ] The web view is able to access device local storage and initialize camera (for older iOS versions, the camera can be accessed only from Safari browser or WebView with `SFSafariViewController`)
- [ ] HTML5 video playback is allowed (`<video>` tags are being used to send instructions): if video-instructions are not played, try using `WebChromeClient` to enable video playback
- [ ] Autoplay in fullscreen mode is disabled and `allowsInlineMediaPlayback` is set as `true` for WebView
- [ ] The selector file is implemented on your side (required for KYC document uploads)

## Iframe requirements

Partner apps that use `iframe` should ensure the following:

- [ ] Parent page header has no restrictions for initializing the camera, e.g. `camera=()`

  - [ ] Parent page can alternatively include `camera=*` in the Permissions-Policy header

- [ ] The iframe allow property has `allow="accelerometer; autoplay; camera; encrypted-media; gyroscope; payment"`
