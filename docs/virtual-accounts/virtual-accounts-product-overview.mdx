MoonPay's Virtual Accounts product allows partners to seamlessly create GBP, EUR or USD Virtual Accounts for end-customers in just a few clicks. These Virtual Accounts are powered by [Iron](https://iron.xyz/) and enable seamless, lightning fast and compliant On-Ramp (fiat → crypto) and Off-Ramp (crypto → fiat) for end-customers. MoonPay handles authentication, KYC, crypto delivery and fiat payouts, enabling you to focus on building the best possible experience.

# Our core features

- **Know Your Customer:** MoonPay handles the entire end-to-end KYC journey for you and your customers in a beautiful, customisable widget that can be embedded in your experience. With 30M accounts and counting, end-customers who have KYCed across our suite of 500+ partners do not need to KYC again, and have a one-click experience.
- **Authentication:** As part of KYC, MoonPay authenticates the end-customer (via email) to retrieve their MoonPay account details. Users who are logged in already do not need to re-login—if you already use another MoonPay product, your customers will have an even smoother experience.
- **Autoramp:** Fiat Payments made into a MoonPay virtual account are instantly 'autoramped', i.e. converted into a cryptocurrency of choice, then sent to the end-customer's wallet address. As a developer, you have the API and webhooks you need to track the transaction status and display its progress to your end-customer.
- **Named Accounts:** When a customer opens a MoonPay Virtual Account, it's opened in their name. This improves the experience for users, and enables use cases like Third Party Payins and Salary Payins.
- **Geographical Coverage**: MoonPay supports users in 106 countries and is planning to rapidly expand into additional markets.
- **Go Live Quickly:** Bring an experience to market quickly, simply design your entry points, load our widget and let MoonPay handle the rest of the experience. While more advanced configurations are available, if you want to move fast, you can.
- **Advanced URL Parameters:** Save your users from having to enter their information twice. Details like the user's wallet address, their Virtual Account Currency (i.e., USD), and their choice of stablecoin can be passed as URL parameters.
