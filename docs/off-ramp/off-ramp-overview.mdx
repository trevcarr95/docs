# Off-Ramp user flow

Using our SDKs, there are several options to integrate MoonPay widget. For example, in a modal overlaid on top of your web app, or in an in-app web view.

To sell crypto, the user goes through the following steps in the widget:

1. Confirm the cryptocurrency, fiat, and amount to sell.
2. Log in to the widget using multi-factor authentication (MFA).
3. Select payout method.
4. Go through KYC, if the user is new to MoonPay.
5. Confirm the sale.
6. Recommended User confirms the crypto deposit in the partner app.
7. Partner app sends crypto on behalf of the user.

## Remove friction for your users

Improve your customers experience and speed things up by pre-filling information such as their wallet address, email, selected token, fiat currency, amounts, and their preferred payment method. Users don't have a digital wallet? We can create one for them using just their email address as they go through the purchase flow.

Through Single Sign-On, users can effortlessly log in using their Google or Apple accounts directly from the widget, serving as a smooth connector between the traditional web (Web 2.0) and blockchain-based platforms (Web 3.0).

For an in-depth look at customization features like pre-populating user information or altering the widget button's color, please visit our [off-ramp parameters page](/docs/ramps-sdk-sell-params).
