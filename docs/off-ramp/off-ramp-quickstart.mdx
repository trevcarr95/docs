## Overview

![](/images/docs/269d611-Screenshot_2024-02-02_at_11.17.47_AM.png)

In this Quickstart, you will facilitate the sale of cryptocurrency via the MoonPay Off-Ramp, directly from your browser.

Whether you are a complete beginner to coding or a seasoned expert, this guide will take you through all of the necessary steps to have you converting cryptocurrency to fiat in no time.

---

## What you will accomplish

In this tutorial, you will:

- Configure Off-Ramps widget in a local environment

  - Create a new folder for the implementation
  - Initialize the widget in a file using HTML and JavaScript
  - Edit the widget parameters
  - Display the fully functional widget locally in your browser

---

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, you will need:

- **A MoonPay account**: If you do not have one, set one up through our team on [this page](https://dashboard.moonpay.com/signup).
- **An IDE (coding software):** Some popular ones are [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/), [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), and [Eclipse](https://eclipseide.org/). We will be using Visual Studio in this tutorial.
- **A web browser:** Any web browser will work. We will be using Google Chrome in this tutorial.

---

## Implementation

### Step 1: Set up a file for your integration

![](/images/docs/4b87dbc-Screenshot_2023-11-06_at_4.01.57_PM.png)

### Step 2: Retrieve API keys from the MoonPay Dashboard

In your IDE, create a new file for your Off-Ramp code. Ours will be called off-ramp.html.

- Navigate to your [MoonPay Dashboard](https://dashboard.moonpay.com/) and log in.
- Once logged in, navigate to the Developers tab on the sidebar ‚Üí API Keys.
  - Here, you will be able to copy your API keys. In this tutorial, we will be using the publishable test key.

### Step 3: Insert HTML and code into off-ramp.html

- The code below will embed our Software Development Kit (SDK) directly into your HTML by way of `<script>` tags.

  - You can think of this as a way of injecting code directly into HTML without having to create a separate linked file


  ```html HTML
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
  <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
      <title>MoonPay Integration</title>

        <!-- Adds the MoonPay SDK as a script to your HTML file -->
        <script defer src="https://static.moonpay.com/web-sdk/v1/moonpay-web-sdk.min.js"></script>

        <!-- Initialize the MoonPay SDK immediately upon page load -->
        <script>
            document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
                const moonpaySdk = window.MoonPayWebSdk.init({
                    flow: "sell",
                    environment: "sandbox",
                    variant: "overlay",
                    params: {
                        apiKey: "pk_test", // Replace with your MoonPay publishable test API key
                        baseCurrencyCode: "eth",
                        baseCurrencyAmount: ".15",
                        defaultBaseCurrencyCode: "eth",

  quoteCurrencyCode: "usd"
  }});

                // Open widget
                moonpaySdk.show();
            });
        </script>

    </head>
  <body>
      <div class="container">
      </div>
  </body>
  </html>
  ```


- This script will detect when the HTML page loads and immediately run the JavaScript within the `<script>` tags when the load has finished. Remember to replace `pk_test` with your publishable test API key from **Step 1**.

- You can customize widget functionality (currencies, amounts, etc.) by adding and removing parameters in the JavaScript, whilst still preserving proper formatting.

  - All parameters can be found on [this page of our documentation](https://moonpay.readme.io/docs/off-ramp-how-to-configure-user-journey-params).

- For example, if we would like to display the widget with a default of selling _.05 BTC to EUR_, and set `lockAmount` to `true` in the parameters so that the user cannot modify the sell amount, we could modify the JavaScript like such:

<CodeGroup>
  ```html HTML
      <script>
          document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
              const moonpaySdk = window.MoonPayWebSdk.init({
                  flow: "sell",
                  environment: "sandbox",
                  variant: "overlay",
                  params: {
                      apiKey: "pk_test", // Replace with your MoonPay publishable test API key
                      baseCurrencyCode: "btc",
                      baseCurrencyAmount: ".05",
                      defaultBaseCurrencyCode: "btc",
  										quoteCurrencyCode: "eur",
  										lockAmount:"true"
                  }});

              // Open widget
              moonpaySdk.show();
          });
      </script>

```
</CodeGroup>

### Step 4: Do a test transaction

* The first step of processing a test transaction using the MoonPay Off-Ramp is to make sure that `environment` is set to`"sandbox"`, as shown above in the example code. This puts your widget in test mode.
* Next, open up the widget, enter your email address, and log in.

* You will be prompted to configure your Sell transaction. Use [our test credit card for off-ramp payouts](/docs/faq-sandbox-testing#test-card-for-off-ramp-payouts) when prompted for a payout method.
* You'll eventually arrive at the below screen. Click on ‚ÄúView deposit details‚Äù.

* You will now see the below screen, prompting you to send the previously specified amount of cryptocurrency to a wallet on the corresponding blockchain. Click the ‚ÄúI‚Äôve sent my crypto‚Äù button.

![](/images/docs/e666794-Screenshot_2023-11-08_at_4.01.33_PM.png)

* When successful, you will see green checks on the Pending, Processing, and Sent pages! ‚úÖ
