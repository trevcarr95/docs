| `apiKey` required              | Your publishable API key. This is used to assign customers and transactions to your MoonPay account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `baseCurrencyCode`             | The code of the cryptocurrency you want the customer to sell. If you pass a `baseCurrencyCode`, the currency will be selected by default and the customer won't be able to select another currency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `defaultBaseCurrencyCode`      | The code of the cryptocurrency you would prefer the customer to sell. If you pass a `defaultBaseCurrencyCode`, the currency will be selected by default, but the customer will still be able to select another currency. If both `baseCurrencyCode` and `defaultBaseCurrencyCode` are passed, `baseCurrencyCode` will take precedence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `refundWalletAddress`          | The cryptocurrency wallet address the funds will be sent to in case we have to issue a refund. If you pass a valid wallet address, the customer won't be prompted to enter one. This parameter will be skipped if `baseCurrencyCode` is not passed. It is mandatory to sign URLs when using this parameter. Learn about [signing URLs](/docs/ramps-sdk-url-signing).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `refundWalletAddresses`        | A JSON string representing the wallet addresses you want to use for various cryptocurrencies in case we have to issue a refund. An example with BTC and BCH wallet addresses:\{"btc": "tb1qst9rvjnhym6kwmdkwgfs4h5dtp7cau5346jp9x", "bch": "bchtest:qraax8trdwct02968swqf4mpq3y5msqp8y7tmalm77"} If the customer selects a cryptocurrency for which you have passed a valid wallet address, the customer won't be prompted to enter one. If you use the `refundWalletAddresses` parameter, only the cryptocurrencies for which you pass a wallet address will be shown to the customer, unless you also pass the `showAllCurrencies` parameter. If both `refundWalletAddress` and `refundWalletAddresses` are passed, `refundWalletAddresses` takes precedence. When using this parameter, you must sign URLs. Learn about [signing URLs](/docs/ramps-sdk-url-signing).                                      |
| `colorCode`                    | The color code for the widget main color. It is used for buttons, links and highlighted text. Only hexadecimal codes are accepted, for example: #FF2B8F. You can also apply a different color for dark mode by adding a comma separated color code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `theme`                        | Enable dark mode or light mode as the default appearance for the widget. Possible values: dark, light.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `themeId`                      | ID of the theme created for your application or website. See [Themes](/docs/off-ramp-how-to-personalize-appearance) page. **NB**: This parameter is seldom used. If you built your theme using the MoonPay dashboard theme builder, you do not need to use `themeId`, as this theme will be applied wherever you use your API key.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `language`                     | The ISO 639-1 standard language code representing the language the widget should use. If you pass a code for a language we do not support, the widget will remain in the current default language. This is usually the language of the customer's browser; if we do not offer that language, the widget will use English (en).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `quoteCurrencyCode`            | The code of the fiat currency you want the customer to be paid in.
