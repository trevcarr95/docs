## Your NFT Smart Contract requirements

We require each NFT smart contract to follow those requirements in order to properly work with our proxy SC

- Your smart contract has to follow either of the specifications:

  - ERC-721/ERC-721a (or compatible) as described in [EIP-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721), specifically it has to call onERC721Received on msg.sender.
  - ERC-1155 (or compatible) as described in [EIP-1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155#erc-1155-token-receiver), specifically it has to call either onERC1155Received or onERC1155BatchReceived on msg.sender.
