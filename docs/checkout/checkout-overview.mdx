## Our integration options

With over **seventy five** different brands, marketplaces and partners having used MoonPay Checkout, we've learnt different partners have different requirements. As a result, we've built out a number different options to choose from.

1. **Hosted checkout:** Want to start selling NFTs without writing a single line of code? This option is for you. In just a few minutes you can deploy a smart contract, give your NFT a name, upload an image, add a price and start selling. We'll even provide you with a simple storefront, so you don't even need a website.
2. **Reservoir:** Is your smart contract supported by [Reservoir](https://reservoir.tools/)? If so, then this option is definitely the best for you. Read more about how to get started with this option [here](/docs/reservoir).
3. **Commerce flow (previously "Contract import"):** Are you doing a primary drop on Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, Avalanche or Arbitrum? This option is probably for you. Simply import your smart contract details into our MoonPay Dashboard to generate an iFrame URL which you can embed on your drop site. Read more about the pre-requisites to getting started [here](/docs/commerce-flow).
4. **Partner driven:** Want to control the way your smart contract is called by providing the callData to execute an on-chain transaction? This option is probably for you. Read more about how to get started with this option here. Please note, this option is only available for Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Avalanche and Optimism networks
5. **NFT Lite:** Are you doing a primary drop / sale on a network not supported by Contract Import? If so, then NFT Lite is likely the best option for you. MoonPay handles everything relating to payments, kyc and fraud but leaves you responsible for NFT delivery. Read more about NFT Lite [here](/docs/nft-lite)
