MoonPay provides a dedicated sandbox environment designed for integration development and testing. Leveraging this sandbox helps you identify potential issues early, ensures compatibility, and minimizes risks during deployment.

## Sandbox on-ramp widget

You can test our on-ramp widget below:

## Initialize the MoonPay widget

Initialize the MoonPay widget using your test API key with our [SDK](/docs/on-ramp-integrations) or with a simple URL ([https://buy-sandbox.moonpay.com/?apiKey=pk_test_INSERT_YOUR_API_KEY](https://buy-sandbox.moonpay.com/?apiKey=pk_test_INSERT_YOUR_API_KEY)). Your API KEY can be found on the [Developers Page](https://dashboard.moonpay.com/developers/api-keys) in your MoonPay dashboard.

## Create a sandbox test account

Know Your Customer (KYC) information entered will not be verified and when asked for documents you can skip by clicking on the "Skip document submission" button. **We recommend adding a US or UK address for sandbox accounts since these work best with our test credit cards**.

## Sandbox Failure Reasons

- `Transaction processing failed` may happen when the testnet wallet is empty or you used the wrong card. Please reach out to your MoonPay representative.
- `Your Region is Not Supported` means MoonPay may not [support your country](https://support.moonpay.com/customers/docs/moonpays-unsupported-countries) or the cryptocurrency is [unsupported in your region](https://support.moonpay.com/customers/docs/list-of-supported-cryptocurrencies). New York, USA is not supported in sandbox but is supported in production.
- `You've made too many actions` or `You can't perform this action` means you have been rate limited. This happens when we detect unusual behavior and is not uncommon for partners to experience this while testing. The recommendation is to wait \~20 minutes before trying again.
- `Account is restricted or blocked` may happen if you are using a production MoonPay user account in sandbox or entered otherwise triggered one of our automated flags for suspicious behavior.

<Info>
  An empty testnet wallet will result in a `Transaction processing failed` error
  when you and other developers try to complete transactions. You may top up the
  wallet with your own testnet coins or use any available online faucet to top
  up Sepolia ETH.
