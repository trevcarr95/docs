Limits are temporary restrictions on a customer's ability to process transactions via their MoonPay account. 

# Types of limits

Customers can encounter three different types of limits on their accounts:

1. Account limits: Customer account limits are determined by their KYC verification status and jurisdiction.
2. Payment method limits: Each payment method also has different limits and will also vary on the transaction type, e.g. buy, sell, or virtual account top up.
3. Minimum and maximum transaction amounts: Transaction minimums and maximums vary depending on the type of transaction and asset. Minimums are determined by our liquidity providers.
